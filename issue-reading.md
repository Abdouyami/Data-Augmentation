# Issue

If .ipynb files are not rendering on GitHub and you see the error "Unable to render code block", here what you can do:

### 1️⃣ Use GitHub's nbviewer
GitHub sometimes struggles with rendering large or complex Jupyter Notebooks. You can use `nbviewer` to open it:

  - Copy the URL of your `.ipynb` file from GitHub.
  - Go to [nbviewer]("https://nbviewer.org/").
  - Paste the link and open it.
